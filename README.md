# README

This is the README for my first real Ruby on Rails project ever, created during Days of Code in Rotterdam 2017.

This web app will search tagged posts on tumblr for images using a search term that the user provides. Then it returns a fully designed pdf A3 poster with images from the search in 72 dpi (otherwise it becomes too slow and Heroku gives me a runtime error).

The app is live on www.tumblypstr.nl and can still use some tweaking. 

This Ruby on Rails app is built using:

* Ruby version '2.3.1'

* Wicked PDF & wkhtmltopdf-binary

* Using the Tumblr API

* Awesome people who helped me to learn more.
